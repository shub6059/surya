== Export Pages from WordPress ==

There are two ways that you can export your WordPress pages. 

The first is by using the built-in export tool which is limited in features, and the second is by using this plugin.

The built-in export tool can be found in the WordPress admin dashboard under Tools > Export. 

From here, you can select which content you would like to export (pages, posts, etc). Once you have made your selection, click on the "Export" button and a file will be downloaded to your computer.

If you want more control over the exported file, or if you want to export pages that are not part of the standard WordPress install, then you will need to use this plugin. 

Once you have installed and activated the plugin, you can find it under the WP Ultimate CSV Importer plugin >> Export (tab). From here, you can select pages as option names and choose a file format to export. The plugin will then generate a file that you can download to your computer.


**Export All Posts from WordPress with Images**
Exporting your WordPress posts is a simple process that can be done in just a few minutes. There are advanced ways to export your WordPress posts. If you want to export your posts without any hassle with more control, then we recommend using Advanced filters to export as a CSV or XML file. 

To export your WordPress posts, follow these steps:

1. Install and activate both the WP Ultimate Importer plugin and the WP Ultimate Exporter plugin. 
2. Upon activation, the plugin will add a new menu item labeled ‘Ultimate CSV Importer"

When you're ready to export your WordPress posts, there are a few things to keep in mind. If you want to export your posts with featured images, make sure to select the "Include Featured Images" option in the Export tool.

If you have any other questions, check our documentation or contact our support. 

== Export WooCommerce ==
Assuming you have a WooCommerce store up and running, use one of the options from the plugin export tab. Once you've made your selections name your file, choose the file format, and apply the advanced option to the Export.

- WooCommerce Products: You can Export all Woocommerce products along with their images, containing all of the products and product data that you selected as a CSV file. 
- WooCommerce Variations (New - will be added in V2.1): Do you have woocommerce product variations? just like products you can get variations that can be exported, manipulated, and imported back if needed.
- WooCommerce Orders (New): exporting orders with status can help you prepare periodic reports, analyses, and studies.
- WooCommerce Refunds (New): export refunds to calculate the percentage along with your sales and marketing reports. 
- WooCommerce Coupons (New): the export can help you find the effectiveness of coupon offers and plan your future promotions

This is useful if you need to export your products, variations, orders, and refund to a spreadsheet for further analysis or manipulation to import back. This file can be imported into another WooCommerce installation or store setup

== Export Categories, Tags, and Taxonomies (New) ==

Taxonomies in WordPress are a way to classify and organize posts and pages into different categories. These categories can be hierarchical, meaning one category is a parent of other child categories, or they can be "flat" without any hierarchy. Taxonomies make it easier to find related content by filtering out unrelated content. 

For example, if you had a blog about cars, you might create the following taxonomies: 

- Make (e.g., Honda) 
- Model (e.g., Accord) 
- Year (e.g., 2005)

If someone wanted to read your blog post about the 2020 Honda Accord, they could easily search for that specific make/model/year combination and find it quickly. 

If you ever need to export your WordPress taxonomies, you can do so in either CSV or XML formats. To export them go to the  “Export” page, and choose from Post tags, Post Categories, or Taxonomies for custom taxonomies. Next, provide a file name and select the file format from CSV, XLS, XML, or JSON formats. Now apply advanced options and click to export and Download Export File.


== Export users ==

There are a few different ways that you can export users in WordPress. 

One way is to export users manually by exporting the WordPress database. To export users from the WordPress database, you will need to connect to your website hosting panel or through SSH to access the database. 

This method is more advanced and should only be attempted by experienced users. 

Another way is to export users through this plugin to export all user data, including metadata, into a CSV file. Select Users as the option from the export tab in the plugin interface. 

Once you have exported your users into a CSV file, you can then import them into another WordPress site. This is how you can migrate your users to import all their data, including metadata, to a new server, hosting, or website from the CSV file.

== Export Menus ==
Click to load the plugin's export screen where you can select what you want to export i.e. menus here. Select "menu" from the list of options you want to export and then click on the Export Selected button. Name the file to process and download the file to your computer.

You can now upload this file to another WordPress site (same or different domain) by going to the plugin > Import tab in the WordPress admin. That's all there is to it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How to export from WordPress =

There are two ways to export your content: 
1. through the WordPress admin panel 
2. or by using an export plugin. 

Exporting through the WordPress Admin Panel is limited and there are plugins available with the most advanced features that the default tool does have. Primarily this export doesn't support CSV, Xls, or JSON files. 

To export your content from the WordPress admin panel, simply navigate to Tools > Export in the left-hand menu. 

From here, you can choose to export all content or only certain types of content (such as posts or pages). Once you've made your selection, click the Export button and save the resulting file to your computer. 

2. Exporting via our plugin 

If you prefer, you can also use this plugin to export your content as a CSV, XML, XLS, or JSON file format. Simply install and activate the plugin, then navigate to the Export screen.

From here, you can choose what to export, once you've made your selection, click the Export button and save the resulting file to your computer.


= 2. How to export the whole WordPress site? how to export it from localhost =

If you want to export your entire WordPress site, including your settings and configuration, you will need to use a plugin or manual method. 

For manual export 

1. Back up your files as compressed files including wp-content or you can do it separately if the size is too big which you can merge later to the root folder. 

2. Ensure you have a copy of the wp-config.php file, it is better to have multiple version copies of this with a prefix or suffix added to the file name. You will end up updating the new domain or subdomain, DB name, DB password, and host details in the wp-config.php file to make it work in a new environment. In case you may need to refer it the old configurations to make sure they are correct.

3. Finally export your WordPress DB as .sql or zip or gzip format.

= 3. How to export wp-content =

You can simply compress it and move it to the desired location. Note that wp-content is the folder where your theme, plugins, media, and backups are stored. You may end up handling a very huge folder, if that is the case you can split and backup them.  

= 4. How to WordPress export database table to csv using a plugin =

If you want to export your WordPress database table to a CSV file, you can use our export tool.

To do this, go to the Export screen in your plugin UI. From there, you can select which type of content you'd like to export. Choose "Posts" if you want to export your blog posts, "Pages" if you want to export static pages, or any other options available.

Choose the file type you wish to export, note you can select between CSV, Xls, XML, or JSON format. Click the "Export" button. This will process extracting the information from the WordPress database as the source and convert them into CSV or XLs files to export. Both CSV and Xls formats are openable in any spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel.

= 5. how to export WP DB =

These steps can only back up the WP core DB export that includes all your posts, pages, and comments. The core files, folders, wp-content, and media such as images, are not backed up. Both have to be managed separately,  you can use a Backup plugin for the whole WordPress site backup. 

Assuming you have a WordPress site up and running, there are two ways to export your database. The first is by using phpMyAdmin, and the second is by using the command line.

2. Select the database you want to export from the left-hand sidebar.
3. Click the Export tab at the top of the page.
4. Under Export Method, select Quick - display only the minimal options.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to export the database file.
3. Export the database with the following command: mysqldump -u username -p databasename > databasename.xml
4. Enter your password when prompted.
5. The database will be exported to an XML file in the current directory.


To use the hosting control Panels

You can back up using cPanel or the hosting panel if it is supported. Search or look for ‘Download a MySQL Database Backup’ under backups. Choose the name of the WP database to download it as gzip file. If you are not sure,  get the DB name from the wp-config.php file in the root.

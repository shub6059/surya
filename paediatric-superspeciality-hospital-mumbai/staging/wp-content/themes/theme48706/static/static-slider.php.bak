			<p>An infant less than 28 days of age is called neonate or newborn. During neonatal period, rapid physiological changes and many critical events can occur. Some ‘neonates’ who are born prematurely (born before 37 completed weeks of gestation), or babies who require resuscitation at birth, babies having respiratory distress, or babies with heart failure or other health issues; or those in whom birth defects may be noticed, need extra medical care and special support. These babies are then admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).</p>
			<p>At Surya, we understand the special needs of these babies and provide them best medical care from our neonatal and paediatric super-specialists as well as support from the best of technology. Combining the best of experts and technology, Surya’s NICU Unit has been largely successful in achieving higher survival rates and lowest complication rates that are comparable with the best in the world. Our unit has successfully looked after premature baby as premature as 23 weeks and as small as 460 grams. The survival rate for extremely premature infant at Surya is one of the best in country.</p>
